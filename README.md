# Pic-Boy-1500

The Pic-Boy-1500 (Personal Information Calendar) is an electronic device manufactured by DrayvCo Industries. It uses ultra-modern super-deluxe resolution graphics, which coupled with its capability to store large amounts of information and transfer data to and from holodisks and from data tubes make it the obvious choice for the wandering explorer, the out-on-his-own newbie or the all-around survivalist expert. 
Use Pic-Boy-1500 to manage your personal calendar and you won't miss any single meeting in the wasteland. :cactus:
